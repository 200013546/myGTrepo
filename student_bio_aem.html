<h2>Alan McCabe</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="http://me" /></p>

<p>Alan McCaben is finishing his first year at DePaul University where he is interested in business. Although he has yet to declare a major, he&rsquo;s considering finance or marketing. After watching his parents run a restaurant for years, he knew at a very young age that he also wanted to go into business. In high school, Alan waited tables at the family restaurant during the summer and was fascinated by the many working parts it takes to operate a successful business. From this experience, he learned the value of hard work, efficiency, and communication. In the future, he hopes to continue his parents&rsquo; legacy and run his own five-star restaurant in downtown Chicago. Alan spends his spare time singing in his church choir and cooking for friends and family.</p>
